# robot3-viz
Visualisation library for Robot3 finite state machines. Work in progress

## Project goals

- Offer a JS-based library for rendering Robot3 visualisations, compatible with JS/TS
- Output to SVG or user-specified resolutions
- Support integration into high-impact use-cases like CI workflows, IDE tooling, CLI tools
- Provide as much freedom as possible to mess with styling / rendering options
- Allow for differing levels of detail but ultimately support visualising all parts of the Robot3 FSM API
